# Nutanix Hackathon 2024 - EUC Benchmark with X-Ray

**Goal: X-Ray scenario with an EUC workload. A workload that simulates a user working with applications. Create a workload with and without MS Office. Metrics from the VMs must be captured and presented in X-Ray.**

Starting points:
- We're using last year's hackathon project "Windows Density Tester" as a starting point.
- We will use Windows Exporter to get metrics from the VMs.

## Tasks

| What | Comment | Who | Completed |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create X-Ray scenario to run workload |  | Dave, Sven | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90) |
| Inject optimizations/GPOs | We‚Äôre working with workgroup VMs, so any (office) optimizations that we normally apply using GPOs need to be injected using the configure-base.yml |  |  |
| Create TaskT EUC workload | TaskT is open source. It will start and interact with applications. It can record start/stop times that we will send to windows exporter | James, Kees | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90) |
| Cluster/Host metrics in X-Ray |  | David, Alan |  |
| VM metrics from Windows exporter |  | Sven | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100) |
| Set # nodes to test on |  | David | |
| Create new scenario for EUC bootstorm testing (optional) |  | | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90) |

## Task Flow

The following flow occurs via the TaskT execution:

| Task Detail | Type | Change Risk | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Launches PowerShell to make sure the resolution is at `1920x1080` | Process Launch | üìó |
| An adobe reg file is imported `Adobe_reg_reader_user.reg` to make it quiet | Process Launch | üìó |
| Import a reg file `Turn_on_show_files_extraction.reg` so that Windows Explorer always plays the same with extraction settings | Process Launch | üìó |
| Launches Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Adobe reader, Edge, 7zip and records the time it takes for each one out to a file | Process Launch/Process Stop | üìó |
| Extract the contents of `c:\scripts\demozip.zip` to `c:\users\nutanix\documents\ZipExtract`. We output the time taken to the same log file | Native Call | üìó |
| via 7zip cli, we then zip those files back up into a file called `c:\users\nutanix\Appdata\Roaming\Test\compaction.zip`. We output the time taken to the same log file | Process Launch | üìó |
| Launch Edge. Stop Edge. This gets past the initial browser update window | Process Launch | üìó |
| Launch Edge, perform a search for `Who is Dave Brett at Nutanix?` then navigate to Daves blog. Then exit | Recorded Procedure | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Copy the file `c:\Scripts\Nutanix.jpg` to `c:\users\nutanix\documents\nutanix.jpg` | Native call | üìó |
| Create a word instance. Add some data, add the above image, save the file, open the file, replace some text. Save to the desktop, and also save a PDF equivalent | Native Call | üìó |
| Launch File Explorer, navigate to the desktop folder, compact the `test.docx` and `test.pdf` file into a zip file `Hello.zip`. Then extract that same zip file to a folder called `hello_its_james` on the desktop | Recorded Procedure | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Copy the file `c:\scripts\Nutanix Slide Library.pptx` to `c:\users\nutanix\documents\Nutanix Slide Library.pptx` | Native Call | üìó |

| Cleanup the current run via `C:\Scripts\Cleanup.ps1` | Process Launch | üìó |
| Wait 60 seconds, and go again | Loop Call | üìó |

### Pending Additions

-  Microsoft Teams. Job is done, it's a launch, wait, click sign in, terminate job. Recorded because CLI fails with permissions on MSIX packages.
-  fio.exe processing - need to tweak, but job is in place


Potential mini benchmark tests to use in the workload (need to be low impact):
- Jetstream (benchmark from last years project)
- 7zip benchmark ("c:\program files\7-zip\7z.exe b -mmt1‚Äù will only use 1 thread)
- fio (with fixed rate and then look at latency)

## Issues/Considerations

-  Be conscious of any changes you make the file system mid-flight, it will impact anything that is pre-recorded. Prefer AppData locations for new/additional items
-  Make sure on anything recorded that you start with nothing, launch, execute, and close gracefully
-  Watch out for input when recorded, the tool does weird things with some text inputs, and also grabbing context of windows when it shouldn't.
-  The tool hates any form of multi-select or grab and drag functions
-  The tool fails on tab keyboard strokes
-  Logging is **c:\users\nutanix\documents\taskt\logs**
-  X-Ray scenario needs to be compressed with 7Zip, it won't work with Windows-native 'Compress to file' explorer option.
  
## Metrics

## App Notes

This workload will:
- Launch calc with a custom timer
- Navigate to Scientific view
- Perform calculation: 0.1 n! (factorial), repeating the n! function for the defined amount in global vars
    * This will stress CPU
    * On the machine used to create the workload was about ~8% usage
- Close calc
