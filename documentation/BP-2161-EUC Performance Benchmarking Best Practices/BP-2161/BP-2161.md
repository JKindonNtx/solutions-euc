# Executive Summary

This document describes the End User Computing (EUC) performance benchmarking best practices that Nutanix defines and aligns to when performing benchmarking. Where possible we have recommended tools and guides that we see as being fit for purpose however these tools will differ in various enterprise deployments.

# Introduction

In this document, we describe our best practices for running EUC performance benchmark tests. At Nutanix, we run benchmark tests with EUC workloads for several reasons:

-  To ensure there is no regression with an EUC workload performance profile when upgrading Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (NCI) to a new version. 
-  To outline the performance impact in various publications, such as Nutanix Reference Architectures, Validated Designs, Technotes, and similar publications.
-  To validate the performance on different hardware platforms, with different CPU, memory, and storage configurations. This helps us fine-tune the Nutanix Sizer tool and educate customers and field teams.

A critical aspect of performance benchmark tests is consistency. Once you can achieve consistent results, you can define a baseline. A baseline allows you to compare changes in infrastructure or configuration, and then measure and assess the impact of that change.

# Nutanix Platform Overview

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

![This image shows an overview of the Nutanix Cloud Platform (NCP). It shows the ability to stretch NCP from your on-premises datacenter to the Public Cloud seamlessly and shows the ability for NCP to consume native cloud services.](../images/BP-2161-EUC-Performance-Benchmarking-Best-Practices_image01.png "Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Software")

Nutanix AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance are never compromised. Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.

Nutanix's software will scale linearly allowing us to baseline a platform then scale that out by adding nodes to demonstrate no degradation in performance whilst adding more compute. 

# Why Run Performance Benchmark Tests for EUC?

Some examples of why you would run an EUC benchmark test are:

-  Baseline the performance profile of the platform.
-  Determine the impact of new software versions (AOS, AHV, Windows OS versions, Citrix VDA, etc).
-  Determine the impact of configuration changes (Group Policy, Profile configuration, etc).

# Benchmarking Tools

There a various benchmarking solutions that you can use to simulate an EUC workload. Keep the following guidelines in mind when selecting an EUC benchmarking solution:

-  The tool must be able to simulate user behavior, such as logging in to the virtual machines, starting applications, opening, editing, and saving documents with various applications. This is called a workload. 
-  It is preferable to be able to use applications in the simulated workload that are used by the user base in production
-  It is critical to have a repeatable workload that will have a consistent outcome.
-  The tool must be able to collect various metrics that can be used to compare multiple tests.
-  If the tool does not provide the data you require, be sure to investigate gathering the required information using other methods available to you.
-  Being able to compare results is critical. Without this capability, you will not have the ability to compare results against different scenarios. A central reporting tool helps to compare results.

Benchmarking tools can be broken into various categories, it is important to define your requirements before deciding on a tool. Once defined, you can design and implement your solution.

Below are some examples of the high-level benchmarking software categories.

| **Category** | **Description** | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| Workload simulator | Software to simulate user workloads on the endpoints being tested | 
| Broker (optional) | The desktop broker platform used to launch sessions | 
| Image deployment | Operating System and application deployment |
| Automation | Automation of the test execution |
| Data Collection | Ability to collect appropriate test data | 
| Storage | Repository to store test results and data | 
| Reporting | A mechanism to analyze and present results| 

When defining and designing your environment for testing, you should have a repeatable and ideally automated process for test execution. Having the test defined and executed identically for every test run is critical to ensure accurate results. 

# Consistency

A good user experience is not only defined by how fast a logon is or how fast an application starts, a good user experience is also a consistent user experience. 

In an EUC benchmark test, you want to understand at what point the user experience is no longer consistent. The longer the experience is consistent, the better the result.

<!--JK: Replaced the below
For example, if a user is used to a logon time of 30 seconds every day, then the logon time increases to 60 seconds, they will most likely start complaining about a slow system. Whilst other users may always have a logon time of 60 seconds and be comfortable with it because "it's always like that". 

If the logon time is inconsistent each time the user logs on they will eventually get used to an inconsistent user experience, but will not happy about it and again most likely start to complain. 

In an EUC Benchmark test, you should see consistent logon times along with consistent application start and operation times. If the average logon time for the first 10 users is 20 seconds, then you should see a similar logon time for the last 10 users of the benchmark test.
-->

To build on this, we can use the commonly measured metric of logon time. Benchmarking tests can be used to identify at what load point, the user logon experience starts to deteriorate. The same test data can also be used to measure the impact of application or patch changes on the logon times.

If you want to know at what point it's not realistic to add more users to the system (what is the maximum number of sessions for this system with this workload), you need to define your acceptable logon time metric, let's use an example of 20 seconds.

If the first 100 users have a logon time of 20 seconds, and the subsequent users start to experience longer logon times, then it is fair to say that the system can comfortably hold 100 users with a consistent experience. You may determine that your acceptable metric is 25 seconds, which will alter your baseline accepted figures for the number of users that can be hosted on a system.

Once you have an accepted baseline created, you can repeat the test and measure changes across different scenarios such as Windows patches, etc.

# Benchmarking Metrics

When benchmarking an EUC workload, the key goal is to understand the baseline performance of your platform. Once you have a baseline, you can measure the performance impact when introducing a change to the environment. 

It is not always possible to achieve an identical usage pattern to that of your user base. However, it is fair to say that if changes are noted against the patterns you are testing, then they will be felt in everyday usage as well.

The best way to determine the user density of a platform is to choose a workload persona as close to your actual user patterns as possible.

With the Nutanix Cloud Platform, you can scale linearly by adding nodes to the cluster. Before you start creating a baseline for the platform at any size, it's important to understand the types of metrics you will be monitoring to measure system and user experience.

## Resource Usage Metrics

The following metrics relate to the system performance directly and need to be kept under certain thresholds for the platform to perform as expected.

### Host Metrics

The below are typical metrics required from a Nutanix host to ensure it is performing correctly.

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Good Result** |

| Average CPU ready time | The CPU ready time | Less than 2% |
| Memory usage | The host memory usage |  We do not recommend to over commit memory |
| Storage controller IO | The host read, write IO  |  A typical read/write ratio for EUC workloads during steady state should be 20-30% reads / 70-80% writes |
| Storage controller latency | The Storage Controller Latency |  < 5ms |

### Virtual Machine Metrics

The below are typical metrics required from the Virtual Machine to ensure it is performing correctly. Good results with these metrics will largely depend on the type of workload you are testing, and acceptable levels should be agreed upon before running the test.

# Setting Up Your Environment for Consistent Benchmark Testing

In this section, we discuss the considerations for setting up the infrastructure to perform a benchmark test.

## Master Image

Building your image is a critical step undertaken when setting up the environment to run EUC benchmark tests. It is this image that will be the basis for all of your baseline testing activity. Ensuring a repeatable, consistent image-building process is key to consistency.

Consider the steps that are normally undertaken to build an Image:

-  Deploy the virtual machine shell to a defined specification.
-  Install and patch the operating system.
-  Install the required software.
-  Optimize the image.
-  Snapshot the image.

![This image shows the process required to create a master image and the steps required to do so.](../images/BP-2161-EUC-Performance-Benchmarking-Best-Practices_image03.png "Master Image Creation")

If this process was only being completed once, then a manual approach would be sufficient, however, as you will be testing various hardware, software, and configuration changes, human error can creep into build tasks. A single non-planned configuration difference during the build can impact the results of your testing.

Key things to consider when building an image are:

-  Automation. Ensure everything is a repeatable task. This includes optimizations across both the Operating System and applications.
-  Ensure your testing team is using the same deployment method for building master images.

## Reboot Before Testing

Before you start a benchmark test, you should consider if you need to reboot components or not. For some components, it's important to start clean, with fresh memory and empty caches. This is especially important for the target machines, as it could cause big variations in test results.

Another consideration is to tune the hypervisor connection from your chosen broker to allow for mass actions to take place (such as reboot) within a given time frame. Please refer to your broker documentation to read the current best practice guidelines.

You could argue that a reboot is important for the hypervisor as well, but in our experience, the impact is negligible, especially when you don't use memory-sharing technology on the hypervisor.

## Clients (Launchers)

There are two methods of initiating a user session on the target VMs. 

-  Direct to the console.
-  Via a remoting protocol.

Connecting via a remoting protocol has the advantage of simulating the use of a display protocol which has an impact on the resource usage of the target VM. If this approach is taken you need clients (physical or virtual) that connect using a display protocol and typically a broker to distribute the session requests from the clients. 

When you use clients to initiate the sessions, it's important to configure these clients with the same specifications. Examples of these configuration options are.

-  Screen resolution. 
-  Display protocol settings. 
-  Offload settings like video and audio.

## Logon Window

The Logon Window is the time to logon all the sessions defined within the test parameters. Another definition that is used is Logon rate, which defines the number of logons per second or minute. 

The logon phase during a benchmark test is often the most resource intensive phase. If the logon window is too short, you will most likely run into CPU contention on the system. 

![This image shows the Logon Window time definition and the steady state for Host CPU Usage.](../images/BP-2161-EUC-Performance-Benchmarking-Best-Practices_image04.png "Logon Window")

In our tests, we always use a logon window of 48 minutes. If a node is capable of logging on 100 sessions on 1 node in 48 minutes, a 4 node cluster of the same type should be able to log on 400 sessions in 48 minutes.

## BIOS settings

Modern CPUs utilize a technology called "C-States" to manage the amount of power that individual processor cores are utilizing.  When a core is idle, the server's BIOS will reduce its clock rate, power draw, or both in an effort to make the system more energy efficient.  In most cases, this is the desired condition as it can significantly reduce power consumption. The unused power may be used by other CPU cores to increase their frequency (GHz), allowing instructions executing on active CPU cores to complete faster.

For EUC workloads, this is not a desired behavior. When these kind of "power throttling" technologies are enabled, users can experience inconsistent performance. It's best to disable c-states to make sure the processors are always running at the same speed. 

In most server brands, setting the BIOS to "(Static) High Performance" will also disable processor c-states.

<note>
Do not change Power Management Configuration settings in the BIOS for Nutanix NX hardware. Nutanix does not support custom power management configurations, and changing the power management settings in the BIOS can cause unpredictable behavior. The Nutanix BIOS contains optimized power management settings by default.
</note>

## Persistent vs Non-Persistent

Unless testing a profile solution where the profiles are saved to a file share then the difference between testing persistent and non-persistent workloads needs to be catered for.

### Persistent 

A persistent workload is one that retains all the user settings at logoff. Any changes the user makes to an application configuration or environment setting are retained and the next time they log in those changes "persist"

### Non-Persistent

A non-persistent workload is one that will not retain any settings at logoff unless specifically catered for by an external profile solution. Any changes that the user makes during their session will be discarded at logoff and the next time they log in they will be treated as a new user.

Looking at the above it's important to note that if you are testing with persistent workloads and performing multiple runs of the same test you will see differences in the logon and user experience metrics from the second run onwards. This is because when the user logs on for the first time their profile is created and set up, this takes a little more time than just loading the profile. From run 2 onwards the profile already exists as the workload is persistent and will therefore reflect this in the metrics being pulled back from the platform resulting in faster logons.

Compare this to a non-persistent workload where the user profile is created as a "new user" at every logon and will therefore have a more stable user experience metric base but may not show the fastest logon times available.

With regard to performance benchmarking as we are looking at getting the most consistent experience possible to show the differences between configuration changes it is recommended to use non-persistent workloads when validating baseline platform metrics.

## Local vs Roaming vs Containerized Profiles

The profile type will have an impact on the test data and additional considerations need to be put in place when testing for this. Details of this can be seen below.

### Local Profiles

 - No profile retention unless testing a persistent workload.
 - All IO on the workload cluster.
 - CPU Load on the workload cluster.
 - No reason to worry about profile size.

### File Based Profiles

 - Profile retention using external file share.
 - IO on workload cluster higher during logon.
 - CPU load on the workload cluster.
 - Profile size needs to be managed via exclusions.
 - File server performance considerations.
  
### Container Based Profiles

 - Profile retention using external file share.
 - IO split between workload and file server cluster dependent on configuration.
 - CPU load split between workload and file server cluster dependent on configuration.
 - Profile size less relevant.
 - File server performance considerations.

Optimizing your profile solutions can have a huge impact on the performance baselines so be sure to pay special attention to the configuration of the profile infrastructure prior to running benchmark tests.

## Optimizations

Operating System optimizations have a huge impact on system performance when dealing with EUC workloads. 

The Problem: "**Windows is full of bloat!**"

Windows can be deployed on thousands of different devices to perform thousands of different tasks. Bloat makes sense here as Microsoft need to cover all the bases to make it work for the consumer across many scenarios. However, in an EUC deployment, many functions of Windows do not make sense. 

Some of these are:

- Windows Updates.
- The XBox Application.
- Wi-Fi Services.

These are just a few examples of the many settings that can be safely disabled on a Windows Server or Windows Desktop operating system before benchmarking the platform. All these services, processes or applications use up precious CPU cycles or memory, therefore decreasing the performance and number of users we can fit onto the platform.

Optimizing an image is a balancing act. You should be looking to disable everything that will not be required to get the best performance, but not be so aggressive that they render the virtual desktop useless. There are various tools available to optimize your master images, ensure you use the tool that's most relevant for your environment.

# Conclusion

- Consistency is paramount when running benchmark tests for EUC. Ensuring that the test conditions are exactly the same for each configuration change is critical for obtaining accurate and reliable results.
- Optimizing your master images can have a big impact on the test outcome and user density with non optimized images using unnecessary resource.
- When designing your workload to test with be sure to mirror production as closely as possible to ensure the results reflect what your users will be experiencing.
- Being able to directly compare (overlay) results is paramount. Having the ability to easily see the performance changes will ensure you know what impact the configuration changes are having in your environment.
- Data retention needs validating. Running EUC benchmark tests can produce a lot of data, keeping this for historical reasons is a valid approach, but the dataset sizes will need to be considered.
- When running benchmark tests be sure to compare all 3 phases of the test (boot storm, logon window and steady state) to get the best possible results.
