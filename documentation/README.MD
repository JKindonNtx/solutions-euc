# EUC Solutions - Documentation

This is a shared repository for the Nutanix EUC Solutions team documentation. 

## Details

This folder is used to keep all the technical documentation for the team.  Please place your document into the relevant folder and if there is not one there, create it!

Images should be into the images folder and NOT sub folders as this is the best practice that the Nutanix Technical Authoring team uses.

Please write all documentation in Markdown.
