# Executive Summary

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

It shows the ability to stretch NCP from your on-premises datacenter to the Public Cloud seamlessly and shows the ability for NCP to consume native cloud services.](../images/RA-2053_image01.png "Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Software")

Nutanix AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance are never compromised. Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.

Citrix Desktop as a Service on Nutanix is a powerful solution that offers unrivaled user experience, simple administration, and web-scale flexibility and economics. In this reference architecture, we make recommendations for designing, optimizing, and scaling Citrix Desktop as a Service deployments on Nutanix G9 Nodes. We used Login Enterprise on Nutanix to simulate real-world workloads in a Citrix Desktop as a Service environment.

In addition to desktop and application performance reliability, you get unlimited scalability, data locality, shadow clones, and a single datastore when you deploy Desktop as a Service on Nutanix. Nutanix takes the Citrix commitment to simplicity to another level with streamlined management, reduced rollout time, and decreased operating expenses.
