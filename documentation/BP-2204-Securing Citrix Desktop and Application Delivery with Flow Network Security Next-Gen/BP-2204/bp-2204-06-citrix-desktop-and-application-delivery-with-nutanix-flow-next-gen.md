# Citrix Desktop and Application Delivery with Nutanix Flow Network Security Next-Gen

A cyber attack is an attempt by an individual or organization (attacker) to gain unauthorized access to a computer system in order to cause harm, steal information or cause malicious activity.

Attackers typically focus on exploiting common vulnerabilities such as implementation errors, old software, and poor authentication within Citrix Desktop and Application deployments. They may also seek to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to Citrix virtual desktops or applications then escalate their privileges within the network. 

Citrix Desktop and Application deployments are normally targeted due to their role in providing remote access to enterprise desktop and applications. These deployments, if not properly secured, can present a valuable attack vector, as they centralize user sessions and application delivery. 

Once inside, attackers can potentially move laterally, extract sensitive data, or disrupt business operations. 

Nutanix Flow Network Security Next-Gen alongside Citrix Desktop and Application delivery can help enterprise IT secure against these attacks.

Integrating Citrix Desktop and Application delivery with Nutanix Flow Network Security Next-Gen offers a powerful solution for enhancing security in virtualized desktop or application environments. 

Nutanix Flow's microsegmentation allows for granular security controls by isolating desktops and applications based on defined policies, reducing the attack surface within the network. This is particularly beneficial in Citrix deployments, where multiple users and applications share the same resources. 

By enforcing strict network policies, Nutanix Flow ensures that any potential threats are contained, minimizing the risk of lateral movement around the network. Nutanix Flow also provides the ability to Isolate or Quarantine entities should an attack be underway allowing forensics to be performed while still providing a secure operational deployment.

The seamless integration of these technologies within Prism Central simplifies management, enabling IT administrators to centrally manage security policies and Citrix Desktop and Application deployment resources. This combination ultimately leads to a more secure, efficient, and agile platform.
