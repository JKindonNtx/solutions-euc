# Citrix Desktop and Application Delivery with Nutanix Flow Network Security Next-Gen

A cyber attack is an attempt by an individual or organization (attacker) to gain unauthorized access to a computer system in order to cause harm, steal information or cause malicious activity.

Attackers typically focus on exploiting common vulnerabilities such as implementation errors, old software, and poor authentication within Citrix deployments. They may also seek to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to Citrix virtual desktops or applications then escalate their privileges within the network. 

Citrix Desktop and Application delivery deployments are normally targeted due to their role in providing remote access to enterprise desktop and applications. These deployments, if not properly secured, can present a valuable attack vector, as they centralize user sessions and application delivery. Once inside, attackers can potentially move laterally, extract sensitive data, or disrupt business operations. 

Integrating Citrix delivery solutions with Nutanix Flow Network Security Next-Gen offers a powerful solution for enhancing security in virtualized desktop or application environments and can help enterprise IT secure against these attacks.

Nutanix Flow's microsegmentation allows for granular security controls by isolating desktops and applications based on defined policies, reducing the attack surface within the network. This is particularly beneficial in Citrix deployments, where multiple users and applications share the same resources. <!--JK: this makes it sound like we have have in guest user based awareness...we might want to reword a touch-->

By enforcing strict network policies, Nutanix Flow <!--Next-Gen?--> ensures <!--JK: Big call - does it ensure, or help?--> that any potential threats are contained, minimizing the risk of lateral movement around <!--JK: within?--> the network. Nutanix Flow <!--Next-Gen?--> also provides the ability to Isolate or Quarantine <!--JK: capitals needed here?--> entities should an attack be underway allowing forensics to be performed while providing a secure operational deployment.

The seamless integration <!--JK: are we integrated, or managed by, in the context of flow?--> of these technologies within Prism Central simplifies management, enabling IT administrators to centrally manage security policies and Citrix resources. This combination ultimately leads to a more secure, efficient, and agile platform.

<!--JK: I took some liberties in reducing the number of repeated iterations of Citrix, Citrix Delivery, Citrix Application and Desktop etc, see if it reads any better - TP will be all over it anyway-->
