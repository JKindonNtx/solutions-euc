# Executive Summary

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

Nutanix AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches ensuring that application availability and performance are never compromised. Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.

Citrix Desktop and Application delivery on Nutanix is a powerful solution that offers unrivaled user experience, simple administration, and web-scale flexibility and economics, coupling that with Nutanix Flow Network Security gives the ability to deliver a secure and performant platform to your end users. 

In this best practice guide, we make recommendations for designing, optimizing, and implementing Citrix Desktop and Application delivery with Nutanix Flow Network Security along with providing relevant performance data pertinent to the implementation of Nutanix Flow Network Segmentation. We used Login Enterprise (Login VSI) and an automated scripting framework on Nutanix to simulate real-world workloads in a secure Citrix Desktop and Application delivery environment.
