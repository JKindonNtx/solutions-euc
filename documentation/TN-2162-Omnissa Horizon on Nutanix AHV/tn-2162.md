# Nutanix Platform Overview

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

Nutanix AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance are never compromised. Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.
