# Nutanix Platform Overview

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.

NetScaler VPX on Nutanix is a powerful solution that offers unrivaled simple administration, web-scale flexibility and economics. By using AOS and AHV combined with Nutanix Cloud Clusters the ability to seamlessly manage and distribute workloads across private and public clouds becomes a reality.
