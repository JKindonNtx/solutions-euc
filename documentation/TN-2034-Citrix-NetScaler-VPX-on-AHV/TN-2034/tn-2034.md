# Nutanix Platform Overview

Nutanix designed its software to give customers running workloads in a hybrid cloud environment the same experience they expect from on-premises Nutanix clusters. Because Nutanix in a hybrid multicloud environment runs AOS and AHV with the same CLI, UI, and APIs, existing IT processes and third-party integrations continue to work regardless of where they run.

![Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Software](../images/TN-2034-Nutanix_Platform_Overview_image01.png "Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Software")

Nutanix AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance are never compromised. Combining features like native rack awareness with public cloud partition placement groups, Nutanix operates freely in a dynamic hybrid multicloud environment.

NetScaler VPX on Nutanix is a powerful solution that offers unrivaled simple administration, web-scale flexibility and economics. By using AOS and AHV combined with Nutanix Cloud Clusters the ability to seamlessly manage and distribute workloads across private and public clouds becomes a reality.

# NetScaler Platform Overview

Enterprises can use NetScaler VPX for on-premises deployments of NetScaler, NetScaler on NC2, NetScaler on AWS, NetScaler on Azure, or NetScaler on GCP for cloud-based deployments. <!--JK: Do we need to include the Cloud native bits here?-->

## NetScaler

NetScaler is the application-centric solution for features like load balancing and content switching, application offloading, attack protection, and application firewalls. It enables the datacenter network to become an end-to-end service delivery fabric to optimize the delivery of all web applications, cloud-based services, virtual desktops, enterprise business apps, and mobile services. The following are just some NetScaler features commonly used when deploying on Nutanix AHV.

### NetScaler Gateway

NetScaler Gateway adds secure and stable full virtual private network and remote access to your Citrix Desktop as a Service (DaaS) or Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (CVAD) deployments. NetScaler Gateway has built-in endpoint analytics using the [OPSWAT](https://www.opswat.com/) engine, so you can easily increase security at the desired level for your enterprise requirements. 

### NetScaler Unified Gateway

The Unified Gateway, which is included in the NetScaler Advanced and Premium editions, offers secure remote access to all your web, client-server, SaaS, or mobile applications. In addition to the HDX proxy functionalities that NetScaler Gateway offers, the Unified Gateway also provides:

- Remote access through a single URL to any application on any device type.
- Single sign-on across all application types through a various identity providers.
- Centralized policy management for Citrix DaaS and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops using Smart Control.
- Support for Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems and for iOS and Android mobile devices.

### NetScaler Web Application Firewall

The NetScaler Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a feature that will prevent security breaches, malicious activity, data loss, and potential unauthorized modifications to your websites that access critical business and customer information. NetScaler Web Application Firewall uses a hybrid approach to security allowing the choice between a positive and negative security model when designing your enterprise WAF policies.

### NetScaler Bot Management

NetScaler Bot Management allows your organization to protect and distinguish traffic from good bots, bad bots, and human clients. Malicious bots consume 30% of your internet traffic and can impact your web applications in ways such as slowing down performance, initiating a DoS attack or spamming email addresses.

### NetScaler AAA Application Traffic

NetScaler Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing application traffic (AAA) gives you the ability to offload authentication to a dedicated AAA virtual server that has specific authentication chains assigned. Using NetScaler nFactor authentication gives you the ability to "daisy chain" authentication to be completely sure the user or endpoint authenticating is actually who they say they are.

### NetScaler Global Server Load Balancing

NetScaler Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) gives you the ability to control entry points into your organization and provide disaster recovery and continuous availability for all your web applications regardless of the datacenter they reside in. Using GSLB gives you the ability to seamlessly move your users around your hybrid cloud without impact to critical business services.

# NetScaler and Nutanix AHV

NetScaler VPX on Nutanix AHV offers secure remote access, web and application load balancing, perimeter security, and acceleration features all in a single virtual appliance. Organizations of any size can deploy NetScaler VPX appliances and take advantage of the ability to scale up or out, depending on their business needs. 

Scale up
: Increase network elasticity with up to five times faster performance on demand, without the need for additional hardware, using NetScaler Pay-As-You-Grow licensing. <!--JK: Is this somethign we should include (Licencing) and is it still accurate?-->

Scale out
: Expand capacity up to 32 times with zero downtime and no idle network resources through NetScaler clustering.

Too often, deploying new applications and application updates is a time-consuming and complex task that taxes already over committed internal IT organizations. Running NetScaler VPX in a virtualized environment, simplifies this process and reduces the time to market for application deployments. 

With the shift to moving network services as close to the application as possible, NetScaler VPX has become one of the most frequently deployed solutions in virtualized desktop and enterprise application environments. NetScaler VPX and Nutanix AHV complement each other to provide a flexible and efficient foundation for end-user computing, applications, security, and more. 

NetScaler VPX on Nutanix AHV offers the following benefits:

- **Enhanced security**
  - NetScaler VPX adds multiple layers that protect applications from direct connections, reducing each application’s attack surface.
  - With enhanced security, self-healing capabilities based on SaltStack, and enterprise-grade VM management, Nutanix AHV delivers the best overall user experience at the lowest total cost of ownership.

  - Application availability and performance monitoring keep organizations connected and protected with room for growth.

- **Visibility, policy and analytics**
  - Nutanix AHV and the features to ensure performance and availability of your VMs <!--JK: this wording is a little off - "the features"? which features? --> means your NetScaler Application Management agents will always be up and performant. This in turn ensures that all your critical data and analytics information is sent back to the Citrix Cloud SaaS service. Using this service ensures all your enterprise applications running on Nutanix AHV behind a NetScaler VPX are performant, available, and secure. <!--JK: I think we are missing context on what we are talking about here - ADM??-->

- **Simple and consistent experience**
  - Running NetScaler VPX on Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) ensures you have the same simple, consistent experience for managing your appliances regardless of the cloud platform chosen.
  - Bare metal access on NC2 means your deployment of NetScaler VPX in the public cloud does not differ to your on-premises experience.
