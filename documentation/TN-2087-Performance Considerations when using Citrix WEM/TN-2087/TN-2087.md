# Executive Summary

This document describes the performance impact of various Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM) settings on the Windows Desktop and Windows Server Virtual Delivery Agents (VDAs) running on a Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (NCI) cluster. We cover the following areas of WEM configuration:

- CPU management
- Memory management

Individual customer results vary, but the performance data reported here gives a general indication of the effects WEM implementation can have on system optimization and provides support for your organization's decision making.

The following components are outside the scope of this document:

- I/O optimization
  - I/O optimization is unique to each environment; there is no defined default configuration.
- Fast Logoff
  - Fast Logoff is a Citrix feature that affects the user experience for logoff processes, not performance. 
- Citrix Optimizer
  - Citrix optimization typically occurs on a base image.
- Multisession optimization 
  - The multisession optimization option only affects disconnected sessions.

# Workspace Environment Management and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

WEM is a software-only, driver-free solution that uses intelligent resource management to deliver improved performance, desktop logon experience, and application response times. It offers enhanced security and elevation controls along with user environment management based on a range of flexible filters and conditions. As there is no long-term service release (LTSR) for WEM, we used the version of WEM from the latest release of the Citrix product set for this performance analysis.

<note>
Although we don't cover the Citrix Cloud WEM service in this document, we expect that it would have similar performance outcomes, as the same optimization features are available for both the on-premises and service offerings. 
</note>

This document focuses only on the system optimization features for WEM. We retained the default configuration for all other components of the solution.

# Performance Testing With Login VSI

## Login VSI Benchmark

Login VSI provides performance insights for virtualized desktop and server environments. Enterprise IT departments use Login VSI products in all phases of VDI operations management&mdash;from planning to deployment to change management&mdash;for more predictable performance, higher availability, and a more consistent user experience. 

The following table includes all four workload definitions available on Login VSI 4.1.

## Interpreting Login VSI Results

Login VSI values represent the time it takes for an application or task to complete (launching Outlook, for example) and aren’t in addition to traditional desktop response times. These figures don’t refer to the round-trip time (RTT) for network I/O; rather, they refer to the total time to perform an action on the desktop. During the test, we turned on all VMs and started the workload on a new desktop until all sessions and workloads were active. The workload used a launch window of 2,880 seconds for all tests.

We quantified the evaluation using the following metrics:

- Minimum Response: The minimum application response time.
- Average Response: The average application response time.
- Maximum Response: The maximum application response time.
- VSI Baseline: The average application response time of the first 15 measurements.
- VSI Index Average: The average response time, dropping the highest and lowest two percent.
- VSImax: If reached, the maximum value of sessions launched before the VSI index average gets above the VSI baseline + 1,000 ms.
- CPU usage during steady state: When all the sessions are active and continue to use the applications. This state simulates the state of the users during the entire day, rather than just during the session startup period.

_Table: Login VSI Metric Values_

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VSI Baseline | < 799 ms | Very good |
| VSI Baseline | 800–1,200 ms | Good |
| VSI Baseline | > 1,200 ms | Average or poor |
| CPU usage during steady state | < 85% | Ideal CPU usage |

## Login VSI Graphs

Login VSI graphs show the values obtained during the launch for each session. The following figure shows an example graph of the test data. The y-axis is the response time in milliseconds, and the x-axis is the number of active sessions.

## Deployment Method

We used Citrix Virtual Desktops 2301 CU1 with Machine Creation Services (MCS) to deploy the desktops on the hosts and only used a single host in each test. We performed three runs of each test using the Power User profile to get an average baseline for each scenario. We chose the Power User profile rather than the Knowledge Worker profile so we could consume enough CPU to invoke the WEM CPU management feature.

# Performance Test Specifics

We performed testing for two scenarios:

- CPU management
- Memory management

## CPU Management

# Conclusion

We ran these tests within a specified time frame and under tightly controlled circumstances to give a basic look at how WEM system optimization features perform from the outset. Given the design of Citrix WEM's system optimization features, keep the following points in mind.

## CPU Spike Protection

The WEM agent records the history of every process on the machine that triggers spike protection. It records the number of times that the process has triggered spike protection and the user for whom spike protection occurred. The WEM agent gains insight into which users trigger spikes and how to handle the spikes more intelligently. If you also enable the **Intelligent CPU Optimization** option, the system flags processes as more CPU spikes occur and eventually launches them with a lower priority, leveling out the CPU load over time. 

Our testing shows that CPU management&mdash;specifically spike protection&mdash;works best (and has less baseline impact) when you use the **Auto Prevent CPU Spikes** option. We noticed the smallest difference between the baseline and test VSImax values with this setting enabled.

## Memory Management

For both Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022, the VSImax dropped significantly when we enabled the **Optimize Memory for Idle Processes** option because the average application response time increased with the user load. Although this technology could be a good choice for memory-constrained systems, be careful that you don't adversely affect your user experience to save on memory usage.

One option for Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) workloads is to use the multisession optimization feature that drains memory only for disconnected users, so you could save on memory in a multiuser environment without affecting the experience for users who are logged on.

## General Conclusions
Because of the product design, WEM CPU management can become more beneficial for your VDAs over time. We recommend using the **Auto Prevent CPU Spikes** option, as this setting had the least impact on the baseline VDA in our testing. 

Use memory management with caution, as it affects other areas of VDA performance in order to save memory. Although there is a specific use case for memory management, be sure to carefully consider and test the repercussions before you implement it in a production environment.
