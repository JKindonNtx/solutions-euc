# Conclusion

The Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops and Nutanix solution provides a single high-density platform for virtual desktop delivery. This modular, linear scaling approach lets you grow Virtual Apps and Desktops deployments easily. Localized and distributed caching and integrated disaster recovery enable quick deployments and simplify day-to-day operations. Robust self-healing and multistorage controllers deliver high availability in the face of failure or rolling upgrades.

On Nutanix, available host CPU resources drive Virtual Apps and Desktops user density, rather than any I/O or resource bottlenecks for virtual desktops. Login Enterprise test results showed densities at 130 sessions per Nutanix node for virtual workloads running the Login Enterprise Knowledge Worker workload. Nutanix offers a pay-as-you grow model that works like public cloud.

Our results show that if you use MCS-published or PVS-streamed servers to linearly scale the Citrix on Nutanix solution, the system maintains the same average response times regardless of how many nodes you have. 

The results from the tests performed on three generations of hardware (G7, G8, G9) show that upgrading to a newer generation will result in a better user experience and a higher density per node.
