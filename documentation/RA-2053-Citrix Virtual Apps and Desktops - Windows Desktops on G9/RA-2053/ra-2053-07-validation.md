# Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops on Nutanix Test Validation

This section provides the details and results of our Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops performance tests on XXXX with Nutanix AHV. We ran each test scenario at least 3 times to ensure accuracy.

## Test Objectives

Our objective was to determine the session capacity we could host on Nutanix using a Windows VDA image and running the Login Enterprise tests with Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops. We tested with the Login Enterprise Knowledge Worker profile.

We had the following specific objectives:

- Determine the maximum number of sessions we can host on this system with the Login Enterprise Knowledge Worker workload while maintaining a good EUX Score.
- Show the linear scalability of the Nutanix platform.
- Show the differences between MCS and Citrix Provisioning on the Nutanix platform.

## Considerations for Test Results

- We used Citrix MCS and PVS to deploy the Windows Server VMs to validate linear scalability.
- We used XXXX to test the infrastructure with Login Enterprise.
- We tested using a single, full-HD screen as the client and limited the frames per second to 16. Using multiple screens or other screen resolution settings affects the results.

## Boot Storm Simulation

The following section provides the performance details of the boot storm simulation test.

## Linear Scalability

The following graphs show the linear scalability of the test runs. We performed the tests with 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 nodes with XXXX VMs per node. The results show good EUX Scores in all scenarios.

### EUX Scores

The following charts show the EUX Scores during the tests.

### Application Performance

The following tables show the linear scalability of application performance over the test runs. A lower result represents better performance.

On average, the host used [#] Watts (W) during the steady state. The [#]-node cluster used [#] W on average during the steady state with [#] active users.

## MCS vs. Citrix Provisioning

In this section, we compare the results of a Login Enterprise test on 8 nodes, using MCS and Citrix Provisioning as the deployment methods.

### EUX Scores

The following chart shows the EUX Base scores from the tests. A higher score indicates a better end-user experience.
