The consolidated RA document has the following considerations and format:

-  Comments identified with a `<!--TEMPLATE CONTENT:` prefix identify a consideration that is pertinent to the document.
-  Text identified and captured using a `example` format need to be reviewed. These should be addressed early.
-  Placeholder items using `Template: Validate_this` are exactly that. Validation objects to confirm.
-  `TBD` is used typically in tables for data input.
-  Four default images are included, the rest are unique to each RA and need to be added with updated references.

To use the template file. Copy it. Easy.

- Review comments and remove non essential components
- Review placeholder items and captured text, update and remove irrelevant components
- Do testing stuff and update document with results
- Any additions/alterations/removals that the template will benefit from, add to the template file and update change tracking
- Any feedback during review process from TP worth capturing, do the same as above

This is a change tracking section for the consolidated RA document.
