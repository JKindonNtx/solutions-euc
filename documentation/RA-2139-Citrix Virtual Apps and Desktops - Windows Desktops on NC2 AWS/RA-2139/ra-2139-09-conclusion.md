# Conclusion

The Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops and Nutanix Cloud Clusters solution provides a single high-density platform for virtual desktop delivery. This modular, linear scaling approach lets you grow Virtual Apps and Desktops deployments easily. Localized and distributed caching and integrated disaster recovery enable quick deployments and simplify day-to-day operations. Robust self-healing and multistorage controllers deliver high availability in the face of failure or rolling upgrades.

On Nutanix, available host CPU resources drive Virtual Apps and Desktops user density, rather than any I/O or resource bottlenecks for virtual desktops. Login Enterprise test results showed densities at 170 sessions per Nutanix node for virtual desktops running the Login Enterprise Knowledge Worker workload. Nutanix offers a pay-as-you grow model that works like public cloud.

Our results show that if you use MCS-published or PVS-streamed servers to linearly scale the Citrix on Nutanix Cloud Clusters solution, the system maintains the same average response times regardless of how many nodes you have.
