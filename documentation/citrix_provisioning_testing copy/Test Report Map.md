# Document Name Test Matrix

## Test Naming Convention

The following naming convention will be used (if possible) when running the tests, comments should be added to display real world test information in the document as these will get exported as part of the graphs.

``<random_6_digit_guid>_<nodes>n_<hv_version>_<hv_type>_<number_of_vms>V_<number_of_users>U_<workload_type>``

for example ``c10289_1n_A6.5.4_AHV_120V_120U_KW``

## Test Details

Testing due to finding extremely high CPU on new LTSR 2402 Servers with Windows 11 23H2. Around 45 minute boot times with manual intervention required. Unable to get all VMs registered.

Booted 900 VMs. Each VM was pinned to a host in blocks of 150. Used Lenovo AMD clusters and standard management cluster.

Boot times are reduced to 20 minutes with LSA disabled and Defender Cache Scheduled tasks disabled. Unsure which had the bigger impacts.

Defender: ```Get-ScheduledTask -TaskPath '\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender\' | Disable-ScheduledTask```
LSA: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa   Value: RunAsPPL = dword:00000000

Both are configured in the `workstation_loginent-def-ctx-2402-pvs-co-O21.yml` playbook

We need to monitor and measure CPU, along with relevant PVS counters on the PVS servers during the tests. Use telegraf. (‚úÖ)

We should also use telegraf to monitor PVS Event logs or VM boot times and compare against CPU load. Each Target boot time is tracked in the PVS log. (‚úÖ)

We may want a separate dashboard for this testing.

### LTSR 2203

Test count: 2

Baseline configuration causing issues in 2402, attempting to replicate challenges found in 2203

| Setting | Configuration | Detail |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| PVS Server: Count | 2 | Even Streaming |
| PVS Server: Spec | 4 vCPU, 12 GiB RAM | Current PVS Server Configuration |

| Target Device: Boot | ISO | Standard Boot Config |
| vDisk: Storage | Local | Current Common Deployment |
| vDisk: Cache Size | 0 | Current Nutanix Best Practice |
| vDisk: Async IO | Disabled | Not tested in happy load state |

Test Details:

| Test Details | Run Count | Completed | By | Comment | Test ID | Logic |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Windows 10 | 1 | ‚ùå | `TBD` | w10_amd_pvs_6n_A6.5.5_AHV_900V_900U_KW_2203_Base | `TBD` | Untested on 2402 currently|
| Windows 11 | 1 | ‚ùå | `TBD` | w11_amd_pvs_6n_A6.5.5_AHV_900V_900U_KW_2203_Base | `TBD` | This broke on 2402 |

Logic:

-  IF Windows 11 shows issues, we know this is not a PVS version issue, rather a Windows 11 Build issue.
-  IF Windows 11 does _not_ show issues, we have a PVS version issue.

### LTSR 2402 Testing

Logic:

- IF Windows 10 has issues, we have a PVS version Issue
- We now have a new baseline configuration to compare future `feature` testing against below

### LTSR 2402 Testing: Feature changes

Now we can test a known state with interesting changes of note. Test Details:

| Test Details | Run Count | Completed | By | Comment | Test ID | Logic |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Windows 11 - 1 GiB Write cache | 1 | ‚ùå | `TBD` | w11_amd_pvs_6n_A6.5.5_AHV_900V_900U_KW_2402_wc_1gb | `TBD` |
| Windows 11 - Async IO Enabled | 1 | ‚ùå | `TBD` | w11_amd_pvs_6n_A6.5.5_AHV_900V_900U_KW_2402_asyncio_enabled | `TBD` |

Logic: 

- Do we need to test Async IO with Write cache set to `0` vs write cache set to `1 GIB`?
