# Citrix DaaS on Nutanix

Citrix DaaS is a desktop virtualization solution that transforms desktops and applications into secure, on-demand services available to any user, anywhere, on any device. With Citrix DaaS, you can deliver individual Windows, web, and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and even full virtual desktops to PCs, Macs, tablets, smartphones, laptops, and thin clients with a high-definition user experience.

Citrix DaaS provides a complete virtual desktop and application delivery system by integrating several distributed components with advanced configuration tools that simplify the creation and real-time management of the virtual desktop infrastructure.

The Nutanix modular web-scale architecture lets you start small and expand to meet increasing demand—a node, a block, or multiple blocks at a time—with no impact on performance. This design removes the hurdle of a large initial infrastructure purchase, decreasing the time to value for your Citrix DaaS implementation. With Citrix DaaS on Nutanix, you can run multiple workloads, all on the same scalable converged infrastructure, while achieving the following benefits.

Modular incremental scale
: With the Nutanix solution you can start small and scale up. A single Nutanix block provides dozens of terabytes of storage and hundreds to thousands of virtual desktops in a compact footprint. Given the modularity of the solution, you can granularly scale by node, by block, or with multiple blocks, accurately matching supply with demand and minimizing the upfront capex.

High performance
: By using system memory caching for read I/O and flash storage for read and write I/O, you can deliver high-performance throughput in a compact form factor.

Change management
: Maintain environmental control and separation between development, test, staging, and production environments. Snapshots and fast clones can help share production data with nonproduction jobs without requiring full copies and unnecessary data duplication.

Business continuity and data protection
: User data and desktops are mission-critical and need enterprise-grade data management features, including backup and disaster recovery.

Data efficiency
: Nutanix AOS storage offers both compression and deduplication to help reduce the storage footprint. Unlike traditional solutions that perform compression mainly at the LUN level, the Nutanix solution provides all these capabilities at the VM and file levels, greatly increasing efficiency and simplicity. These capabilities ensure the highest possible compression and decompression performance, even below the block level.

Enterprise-grade cluster management
: Nutanix provides a simplified and intuitive approach to managing large clusters, including a converged GUI that serves as a central point for servers and storage, alert notifications, and the bonjour mechanism that automatically detects new nodes in the cluster.

High-density architecture
: Nutanix uses an advanced server architecture that, using the NX-3000 series as an example, can house eight Intel CPUs (up to 192 cores) and up to 8 TB of memory in a single 2RU appliance. Coupled with data archiving and compression, Nutanix can shrink your desktop hardware footprint.

Time-sliced clusters
: Like public cloud EC2 environments, Nutanix can provide a truly converged cloud infrastructure, so you can run your server and desktop virtualization on a single cloud.
