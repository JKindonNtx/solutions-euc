# EUC Solutions

This is a shared repository for the Nutanix EUC Solutions team. 

## Rules Of Engagement

The following are the rules/guidelines for this repository, please follow them as they are there to ensure that we don't loose code or double up on work efforts.

- Please create a new Branch for all commits and do not commit directly to main. This is so that GitHub can vet the changes you are implementing and anything you have written will not get inadvertantly over-written by someone else.
- Branch naming. Please prefix each branch with your initials then an underscore then what the branch is for i.e. db_update_main_readme
- All code here is provided "as-is" and should be tested / reviewed before being used in a production environment.
- If you want to pick up some development work then go to the issues log, create a branch and get to work!

If you have any issues then please reach out to a member of the team.

Thanks!
